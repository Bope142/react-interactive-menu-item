# React Interactive Media Overlay

This project is a React application that provides an interactive experience with media overlays. The app displays different profiles as images or a video based on the user's selection from a menu.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the work of the agency featured on Awwwards, specifically the [Wandergates](https://www.awwwards.com/sites/wandergates) site. I recreated a section in CSS to achieve a similar visual style and interactivity.

## Features

- **Interactive Menu**: Select different profiles from the menu.
- **Media Overlay**: Display images or a video in an overlay based on the selected profile.
